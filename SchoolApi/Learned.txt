ActionResult:
Wrapper for response.
Can be use to redirect or return the response with a specific http code.
No need for ActionResults when there is always a valid response (ex: GetAll)

Functional Programming:
- Select = Map
- Where = Filter

// Not sur of that
In model no need for to store the Foreign Key, just the reference to the object.
EntityFramework will take care of the rest.
